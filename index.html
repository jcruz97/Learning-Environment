  <h1> MARKDOWN</h1>

   <h2>Short Story</h2>

    <p>Widely used to make readme files or even on online forums, 
        it's simple to understand ans works pretty well.
        Easy to use, it has been used since 2004 and 
        is well supported in numerous websites around the WWW.

         <li>Overview</li>
         <p> Markdown can be transcprited into HTML and has the same results for text editing but again, 
             it's heckin' simple to write readme files into `.md` than into `.html`.</p><br>
         <li>Requirements</li>
         <p>As every coding language you need a computer (big brain time here) and a IDE that can support `.md` files but don't worry 
             on it as most of them do as they are really convenient for readme files.  
             Here is a nice IDE to download in the links provided below.
